# Memory Duplicate Fix

## Problem

The memory system was logging messages twice, resulting in 4 messages instead of 2 for each conversation turn:
- User message was added manually + automatically by ConversationalRetrievalChain
- AI response was added manually + automatically by ConversationalRetrievalChain

## Root Cause

The issue was in `utils/conversation_manager.py` where the `add_message()` function was manually adding messages to memory:

```python
# OLD CODE (causing duplicates)
def add_message(role, content):
    messages = get_current_messages()
    messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
    
    # Add to memory - THIS WAS CAUSING DUPLICATES
    memory = get_current_memory()
    if role == "user":
        memory.add_user_message(content)
    elif role == "assistant":
        memory.add_ai_message(content)
```

The `ConversationalRetrievalChain` already automatically manages memory, so manual addition was redundant and caused duplicates.

## Solution

Removed manual memory addition from the conversation manager:

```python
# NEW CODE (no duplicates)
def add_message(role, content):
    messages = get_current_messages()
    messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
    
    # Note: Memory is automatically managed by ConversationalRetrievalChain
    # No need to manually add to memory here
```

## Benefits

- âœ… **No more duplicates**: Each message is logged only once
- âœ… **Cleaner memory**: Accurate token counting and message tracking
- âœ… **Simplified code**: Less manual memory management
- âœ… **Better performance**: No redundant memory operations

## How It Works Now

1. **User sends message** â†’ Added to conversation history only
2. **ConversationalRetrievalChain processes** â†’ Automatically manages memory
3. **AI responds** â†’ Response automatically added to memory by the chain
4. **Memory tracking** â†’ Accurate token count and message count

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- âœ… Messages are logged only once
- âœ… Token counting is accurate
- âœ… Memory management works correctly
- âœ… UI displays correct message counts
